## The Brief 

1. Please document your code appropriately.
2. Set up a NextJS project with TypeScript.
3. Use the ChakraUI component library for UI elements.
4. Have a welcome modal with two separate slides:
a. On the first modal slide, have the user set a username.
b. On the second modal slide, have the user set their job title.
c. Save the user’s username and job title information in the way you best see fit.
d. You should be able to view this information somewhere once you log in, and be able to
change it.
e. The user’s information should also be persisted.
5. Use Apollo client to query a public GraphQL API.
6. Display the GraphQL API data as items on an “Information Page” that is mobile and tablet
compatible.
7. Users should not be able to view the “Information Page” until the user has set their information.
8. Have it so when you click a listed item on the “Information Page”, it should open a modal that
displays the information about that item.
9. Deploy on Vercel free tier.
